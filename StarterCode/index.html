          <h5 class="h5"> Insight 1</h5>
          <p class="p">When looking at the relationship between the unhealthy behaviors and poverty, we observe the
            positive correlation with each factor
            States including Missisipi and New Mexico are found high in poverty that also have relatively higher rate of
            obisity, smoking, and healthcare.
            On the other hand, states with low in poverty like New Hampshire and Maryland have shown relatively lower
            health risks
          </p>
          <h5 class="h5"> Insight 2 </h5>
          <p class="p">The data also shows the median age of each state and Maine has the highest median age. High rate
            of healthcare could be seen as a factor for this trend.
            Interestingly, they do not show considerably lower rate of smoking and obesity. Otherwise, Utah has the
            lowest median age. However, their risk factors do not seem
            to be very relevant. I assume that there would be other factors to have the lowest median age.
          </p>

          <h5 class="h5"> Insight 3 </h5>
          <p class="p">When we consider household income, the most noticeable relationship has found in obesity rate.
            The lower income they earn, higher obesity has been observed. Additionally, the States with low household
            income also tend to
            have more number of smokers.
